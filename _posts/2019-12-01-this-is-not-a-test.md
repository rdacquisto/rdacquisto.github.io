title: This is not a test
---

Well, actually this is a test. Today I added the `jekyll-admin` plugin. I initially was looking for a CLI script that would just put the date in with a path safe title. This plugin might change that.

These are the initial issues I have uncovered:
* Posts are not saved with a newline character at the end of files.
* Most of the config fields are omitted by default. Note: This actually doesn't seem like an issue. However, I tend to perfer pedantic configuration.

Despite these initial issues, I am going to give the plugin a try. We will see if I end up not using it in the end.
